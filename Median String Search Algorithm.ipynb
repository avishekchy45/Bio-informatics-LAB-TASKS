A median string is a string that minimizes the total Hamming distance (the number of positions at which the corresponding symbols are different) between itself and all given sequences. This is useful in motif finding, where we aim to find a common substring (motif) in a set of sequences. The goal of this algorithm is to find a string `s` of length `l` such that the sum of Hamming distances between `s` and every sequence from the given set of `k` DNA sequences is minimized.\n","\n","Here's how we can implement it step by step:\n","\n","1. Generate all possible strings of length `l` from the four nucleotides (A, C, G, T).\n","2. Compute the Hamming distance between the generated string and each substring of the sequences.\n","3. Minimize the total distance and return the string.\n","\n","The algorithm's complexity is $O(4^l × n × m)$, where `l` is the length of the median string, `n` is the number of sequences, and `m` is the length of the sequences. This makes it exponential in `l`, so it is only practical for small values of `l`.\n"]},{"cell_type":"code","execution_count":6,"metadata":{"executionInfo":{"elapsed":509,"status":"ok","timestamp":1726524723575,"user":{"displayName":"Avishek Chowdhury","userId":"14734427622886483691"},"user_tz":-360},"id":"IFlCpTzzT1IK"},"outputs":[],"source":["import itertools"]},{"cell_type":"markdown","metadata":{"id":"xmx6Vw4bIiyR"},"source":["## Calculating Hamming Distance"]},{"cell_type":"markdown","metadata":{"id":"Qwx44wJVImwJ"},"source":["The `hamming_distance` function computes the Hamming distance between two strings `s1` and `s2` of equal length."]},{"cell_type":"code","execution_count":7,"metadata":{"executionInfo":{"elapsed":23,"status":"ok","timestamp":1726524724028,"user":{"displayName":"Avishek Chowdhury","userId":"14734427622886483691"},"user_tz":-360},"id":"gTUea9W-GnGv"},"outputs":[],"source":["def hamming_distance(s1, s2):\n","    # distance = 0\n","    # for i in range(len(s1)):\n","    #     if s1[i] != s2[i]:\n","    #         distance += 1\n","    distance = sum(c1 != c2 for c1, c2 in zip(s1, s2))\n","    return distance\n"]},{"cell_type":"markdown","metadata":{"id":"JX1zJ83RJrR6"},"source":["## Calculating Distance to Closest Pattern"]},{"cell_type":"markdown","metadata":{"id":"xocoJMQMJwVR"},"source":["The `distance_to_closest_pattern` function will find the closest substring (in terms of Hamming distance) within each DNA sequence.
