It is the process of comparing two or more biological sequences, typically DNA, RNA, or protein sequences to identify regions of similarity. With biological sequences, it is often necessary to align two sequences that are of different lengths, or that have regions that have been inserted or deleted over time. Thus, the notion of gaps needs to be introduced. In this case, a gap is denoted in the alignment by a '-' character. An alignment can produce one of the following: a match between two characters, a mismatch between two characters (also called a substitution or mutation), a gap in the first sequence (which can be thought of as the deletion of a character in the first sequence), or a gap in the second sequence (which can be thought of as the insertion of a character in the first sequence). By aligning sequences globally or locally, researchers can gain insights into how genes, proteins, or entire genomes are related across species, how they evolve, and how their structures and functions are conserved.\n","\n","Global alignment attempts to align the entire length of two sequences. This method is useful when the sequences are of similar lengths and there is an expectation that they are related over their entire lengths. Needleman and Wunsch (1970) were among the first to describe a dynamic programming algorithm for global sequence alignment. The Needleman-Wunsch algorithm uses dynamic programming to find the optimal alignment between two sequences.\n","\n","Here's how we can implement it step by step:\n","\n","1. **Initialization**: At first, we have to define the sequences (`seq1` and `seq2`), and the scoring parameters (`match_score`, `mismatch_score` and `gap_penalty`). Then a scoring matrix needs to be created with dimensions (`len(seq1) + 1) x (len(seq2) + 1`). The first row and column are initialized based on gap penalties. The first row is set to (`i x gap_penalty`) and the first  column is set to (`j x gap_penalty`). Here, `i` and `j` are the number of rows and columns respectively.\n","\n","2. **Matrix Filling**: The rest of the scoring matrix is filled using dynamic programming, with match, mismatch, and gap penalties to determine the score. For each cell (i, j), the score is calculated as follows:\n","\n","  $S_{(i, j)}$ = $MAXIMUM$ $[$\n","  $S_{(i - 1, j - 1)}$ + `match or mismatch score`,\n","  $S_{(i, j - 1)}$ + gap_penalty,\n","  $S_{(i - 1, j)}$ + `gap_penalty` $]$\n","\n","3. **Traceback**: Once the matrix is filled, the optimal alignment is obtained by tracing back from the bottom-right of the matrix to the top-left. During this process, we'll construct two aligned sequences by following the optimal path, which is based on the scoring rules. The trace gives us the alignment, which is the optimal match of both sequences. For traceback, we move diagonally when it's a match or mismatch, up when there's a gap in seq2, and left when there's a gap in seq1. At the end, we handle any remaining characters if one sequence is longer than the other.\n"]},{"cell_type":"code","execution_count":5,"metadata":{"executionInfo":{"elapsed":697,"status":"ok","timestamp":1726520926755,"user":{"displayName":"Avishek Chowdhury","userId":"14734427622886483691"},"user_tz":-360},"id":"QPn5gGPON6mv"},"outputs":[],"source":["import numpy as np\n","import pandas as pd"]},{"cell_type":"code","execution_count":4,"metadata":{"executionInfo":{"elapsed":3,"status":"ok","timestamp":1726520927242,"user":{"displayName":"Avishek Chowdhury","userId":"14734427622886483691"},"user_tz":-360},"id":"gTUea9W-GnGv"},"outputs":[],"source":["def needleman_wunsch(seq1, seq2):\n","    # Scoring parameters\n","    match_score, mismatch_score, gap_penalty = 5, -3, -4\n","\n","    # Initialize the scoring matrix\n","    len_m, len_n = len(seq1), len(seq2)\n","    scoring_matrix = [[0 for j in range(len_m + 1)] for i in range(len_n + 1)]\n","\n","    # Initialize the first row and column with gap penalties\n","    for i in range(1, len_n + 1):\n","        scoring_matrix[i][0] = i * gap_penalty\n","    for j in range(1, len_m + 1):\n","        scoring_matrix[0][j] = j * gap_penalty\n","\n","    # Fill in the scoring matrix\n","    for i in range(1, len_n + 1):\n","        for j in range(1, len_m + 1):\n","            # print(i, j)\n","            if seq2[i -
