Each exon corresponds to a segment of DNA that is expressed and contributes to a final gene product. The goal is to find a subset of these exons (intervals) such that the sum of their scores is maximized, while ensuring that no two exons overlap. The Exon Chaining problem can be solved using dynamic programming. We are given a set of intervals (exons), where each interval has a start point, an end point, and a score. The goal is to find the highest-scoring subset of intervals such that no two intervals overlap.\n","\n","\n","Here's how we can implement it step by step:\n","\n","1. **Sorting Intervals**: The intervals (exons) are sorted based on their endpoints, which simplifies the problem because we only need to consider intervals that end before the current interval starts.\n","2. **Dynamic Programming Table**:\n","  * $dp[i]$ will store the maximum score achievable up to interval `i`.\n","  * For each interval `i`, we calculate the maximum score by either including or excluding it.\n","  * If we include interval `i`, we add its score to the best solution that doesn't overlap with `i`, which is found by checking all previous intervals.\n","  * The helper function `find_previous` looks for the rightmost interval that does not overlap with the current interval.\n","3. **Backtracking**: After calculating the optimal scores, we backtrack to reconstruct the set of intervals that form the optimal solution.\n","\n","For the implementation, Sorting the intervals takes $O(nlogn)$, where n is the number of intervals and filling the dynamic programming table takes $O(n^2)$, as for each interval `i`, we potentially check all previous intervals to find the rightmost non-overlapping one. This gives an overall time complexity of $O(n^2)$. With optimizations (e.g., using binary search), the time complexity can be improved to $O(nlogn)$.\n"]},{"cell_type":"code","execution_count":1,"metadata":{"executionInfo":{"elapsed":470,"status":"ok","timestamp":1726525398265,"user":{"displayName":"Avishek Chowdhury","userId":"14734427622886483691"},"user_tz":-360},"id":"Ho574IrVI4mo"},"outputs":[],"source":["def exon_chaining(intervals):\n","    # Step 1: Sort intervals by their end points\n","    intervals.sort(key=lambda x: x[1])\n","\n","    # Number of intervals\n","    n = len(intervals)\n","\n","    # dp[i] will store the maximum score up to interval i\n","    dp = [0] * n\n","    # To reconstruct the solution, store the previous index\n","    previous = [-1] * n\n","\n","    # Helper function to find the rightmost non-overlapping interval\n","    def find_previous(intervals, i):\n","        for j in range(i - 1, -1, -1):\n","            if intervals[j][1] <= intervals[i][0]:\n","                return j\n","        return -1\n","\n","    # Step 2: Fill the dp array\n","    for i in range(n):\n","        # Option 1: Exclude the current interval, take the best score up to i-1\n","        dp[i] = dp[i - 1] if i > 0 else 0\n","\n","        # Option 2: Include the current interval\n","        previous_idx = find_previous(intervals, i)\n","        score_with_current = intervals[i][2]  # Score of the current interval\n","\n","        if previous_idx != -1:\n","            score_with_current += dp[previous_idx]\n","\n","        # Take the maximum of excluding or including the current interval\n","        dp[i] = max(dp[i], score_with_current)\n","\n","        # Keep track of the best option\n","        if dp[i] == score_with_current:\n","            previous[i] = previous_idx\n","\n","    # Step 3: Backtrack to find the optimal set of intervals\n","    result = []\n","    i = n - 1\n","    while i >= 0:\n","        if previous[i] != -1 or dp[i] > (dp[i - 1] if i > 0 else 0):\n","            result.append(intervals[i])\n","            i = previous[i]\n","        else:\n","            i -= 1\n","\n","    return result[::-1]  # Return the intervals in sorted order\n"]},{"cell_type":"markdown","metadata":{"id":"cCzuxxMjKObx"},"source":["## Testing the Algorithm"]},{"cell_type":"code","execution_count":2,"metadata":{"colab":{"base_uri":"https://localhost:8080/"},"executionInfo":{"elapsed":13,"status":"ok","timestamp":1726525398721,"user":{"displayName":"Avishek Chowdhury","userId":"14734427622886483691"},"user_tz":-360},"id":"_4DDSU3QHQzP","outputId":"1320bfbf-854e-4f62-f5f2-c7f40fdfca69"},"outputs":[{"name":"stdout","output_type":"stream","text":["Optimal set of exons: [(2, 3, 3), (4, 8, 6), (9, 10, 1), (11, 15, 7), (16, 18, 4)]\n"]}],"source":["intervals = [ # (start, end, score)\n","    (1, 5, 5),\n","    (2, 3, 3),\n","    (4, 8, 6),\n","    (6, 12, 10),\n","    (7, 17, 12),\n","    (9, 10, 1),\n","    (11, 15, 7),\n","    (13, 14, 0),\n","    (16, 18, 4)\n","]\n","optimal_exons = exon_chaining(intervals)\n","print(f\"Optimal set of exons: {optimal_exons}\")"]}],"metadata":{"colab":{"authorship_tag":"ABX9TyOE0AIUOLKD3tkNedx6+p3l","provenance":[]},"kernelspec":{"display_name":"Python 3","name":"python3"},"language_info":{"codemirror_mode":{"name":"ipython","version":3},"file_extension":".py","mimetype":"text/x-python","name":"python","nbconvert_exporter":"python","pygments_lexer":"ipython3","version":"3.9.7"}},"nbformat":4,"nbformat_minor":0}
