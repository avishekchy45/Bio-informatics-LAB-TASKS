The goal is to find the positions of the points on the line (which could represent restriction sites in a DNA sequence) from the given set of pairwise distances (which could be obtained from a DNA fragment). The Partial Digest Algorithm is a recursive, backtracking approach to reconstruct the positions of points from a set of pairwise distances. It is used in bioinformatics, especially for problems like DNA restriction mapping. By trying different placements for points and backtracking when necessary, the algorithm can solve the problem efficiently.\n","\n","The Partial Digest Algorithm is a combinatorial algorithm used to reconstruct a set of points on a line given the pairwise distances between them. Given a multiset D of distances between pairs of points, we need to find the positions of the points that generate this multiset.\n","\n","Here's how we can implement it step by step:\n","\n","1. Start by identifying the largest distance L in D, which corresponds to the distance between the two outermost points and place the points at positions 0 and L.\n","2. Recursively place the remaining points while removing distances from D.\n","3.
